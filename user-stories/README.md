#  User Stories – Airbnb Clone Backend

This document contains user stories derived from the use case diagram for the Airbnb Clone backend. These user stories represent core interactions between users and the system and help guide backend development from a user-centric perspective.

##  What Are User Stories?

User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability—usually a user or customer. They follow a standard format:

> **As a** [user role], **I want** [goal] **so that** [reason].

##  Purpose of This Document

The goal of this document is to:
- Translate backend features into real-world user scenarios.
